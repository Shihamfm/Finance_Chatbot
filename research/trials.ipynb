We report our estimates of the\\nnumbers of our daily active people (DAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who\\nvisited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.\\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are\\ninherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our\\nestimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for\\ncalculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to\\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or\\nadjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as\\ndata limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base\\nthat have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further\\nbelow, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such\\nmargin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across\\nproducts to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do\\nnot match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example,\\nto match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user\\nnames. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the\\nfuture contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products,\\nwe have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with\\naccounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product\\ndecisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy\\n4'),\n",

Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies\\nevolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or\\nmachine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of\\n2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited\\nsample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated\\nwith Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\\nperiod. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nUser Geography\\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by\\nuser location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is\\nestimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\\'s\\nactual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the\\nuser\\'s actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\\n5'),\n",

Business\\nOverview\\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\\nWe build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and\\nshare with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, augmented reality (AR), and\\nwearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos,\\nvideos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by\\naccessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build\\nthe next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies.\\nWhile the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful,\\nand immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery\\nengine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that\\nmake our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI\\nglasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from\\nselling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a\\nrange of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery\\nengine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure\\ncapacity.\\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in\\nFoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical\\ninfrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and\\nwearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other\\nfoundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development\\nacross these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may\\nonly be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our\\nRL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the next computing platform is dependent\\non generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business.

Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a place for people to share life's\\nmoments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover and connect to people with shared interests, and create economic\\nopportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, Marketplace, and more.\\n• Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Live, and messaging are places\\nwhere people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their\\nfavorite businesses.\\n• Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses\\nacross platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls.\\n• Threads. Threads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come together to discuss topics of interest.\\nPeople can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who love the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their\\nideas, opinions, and creativity with the world.\\n• WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses around the world to\\ncommunicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a one-to-many broadcast service designed to help\\npeople follow information from people and organizations that are important to them.\\nReality Labs Products\\nMany of our Reality Labs investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market\\ntoday and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets\\npeople control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the near term,\\nwe are continuing to develop early metaverse and wearables products and experiences that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.\\nOur metaverse efforts include our VR, MR, and social platform initiatives. Our current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well\\nas software and content available through the Meta Horizon Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while\\nengaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. To drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have introduced MR capabilities, which allow users\\nto experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest devices.\\nOur wearables efforts include our AR initiatives. We have continued to advance our roadmap to include additional AI-enabled offerings such as the Ray-\\nBan Meta AI glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as other features such as hands-free interaction. As we continue our\\nlong-term efforts to bring AR glasses to market, in 2024 we also unveiled our Orion prototype, a pair of true AR glasses that overlay content on top of the\\nphysical world. It does this with an industry-leading field of view and in glasses form factor for comfortable wear.\\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the next computing platform, our metaverse efforts also\\ninclude notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our wearables efforts are primarily directed toward\\nlonger-term research and development projects. For example, in 2025, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our\\nwearables initiatives, and the remaining 50% on our metaverse initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are\\ncertain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the next computing platform and our business strategies\\nevolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and\\nmarket landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\\n7\"),\n",

We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but\\nnot limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to\\nreach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use\\nour free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We\\nalso compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual reality products and services. We also expect to\\nface additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and\\nservices, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the\\nmetaverse.\\nTechnology\\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that\\nour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with\\nproducts like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed\\nand built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third\\nparties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network\\ncapacity.\\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers\\nand developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen\\nour systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things,\\nrecommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery,\\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.\\nWe also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our Llama models, consisting of state-of-the-art foundation models that are\\navailable for researchers and developers to use and build upon. By making our Llama models openly available, we aim to accelerate AI research and\\ndevelopment, improve our own products, and to foster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community.\\nSales and Operations\\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that\\nis focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-\\nmaking to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers.\\nWe operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to\\nprovide direct customer support to our users and partners.\\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers, resellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel,\\nMeta.com.

In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties.\\nWe do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the\\nduration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still\\nevolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including\\nprivacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of\\npublicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\\ndata disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political\\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions,\\nor other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and\\nregulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\\nvarious ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in the past and could in the future\\nadversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by\\nimposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral\\nargument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230)\\nwas at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation\\nconcerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online platforms under\\nSection 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could\\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\\nIf we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products\\nand services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely\\naffect our financial results. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European\\nUnion to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union\\n(CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to\\nregulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May\\n12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine\\nof EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into\\ncompliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage,\\n9\"),\n",

We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on\\nMarch 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\\n(EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities\\n(E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General\\nas a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United\\nStates. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union\\nto organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States\\nDepartment of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome\\nmilestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two\\nprior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty\\nand lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would\\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\\nunder the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead\\nEuropean Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other\\nrequirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations\\nby the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR\\'s consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes\\nin the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those\\nregulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a\\nresult, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\\nuncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and\\nother countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their\\nrespective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency\\nrules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to\\ncontrol the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford\\nusers with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\\nbusiness. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents\\nor guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and\\nservices provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the\\nePrivacy Directive\\'s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which\\ncould directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the\\nuse of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these\\nor similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory\\ndevelopments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European\\nEconomic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no\\nads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets\\nAct (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our\\n\"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our\\nmodel does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the European Data Protection\\nBoard has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding\\nour compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union,\\nEuropean Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads,\\n10'),\n",

These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our\\nuser growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European\\nUnion imposes restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and\\nacquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated\\ngatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our\\nproducts or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future\\nproposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to\\nour business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and\\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of\\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have\\npassed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar\\nrequirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering\\nof our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to\\ncollect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For\\nexample, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to\\nminors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of\\nthem) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders\\nmay expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be\\nenjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent\\nlegislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain\\nsocial media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of\\nexisting laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by\\nthird parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could\\nsubject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions.\\nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government\\nauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data\\nprotection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject\\nrights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise\\nobjectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees,\\nincluding the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things,\\nrequired us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our\\ncompliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court,\\nthat alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade\\nCommission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its\\ncurrent form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years\\nold. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us\\nto civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our\\nbusiness practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and\\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\\nadversely affect our business.\\n11\"),\n",

We make it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and provide a generous severance package. For U.S. employees, that\\nincludes severance payments, payment for all remaining paid time off, and restricted stock unit vesting through their last day on payroll, as well as certain\\ncontinuing coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families, career services with an external vendor, and immigration support.

Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal experience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such\\nas those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and\\ncompany changes. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the company.\\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being\\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our\\nemployees\\' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity.

Our financial performance has been\\nand will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions,\\nparticularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user\\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also\\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our\\nproducts and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to\\nincreases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in\\nconnection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian\\ngovernment, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any future declines in the size of our active\\nuser base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or\\nincrease the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their\\nactive user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active\\nuser base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and\\nour competitors introduce new and different products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement,\\nincluding if:\\n• users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\\n• we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to\\nexisting products and services, that are not favorably received;\\n• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and\\nquality of ads that we display;\\n• users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we\\nrely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\\n• user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;\\n• we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems\\nand networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\\n15\"),\n",

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the\\nCCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the\\nnumber of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy\\nDirective compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other\\nU.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing\\nadditional rights for users and could result in restrictions on our use of signals from third-party apps and websites through certain browser- and device-based\\nuniversal opt-out mechanisms. Judicial and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may\\nrequire us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For\\nexample, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began\\noffering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with\\nrequirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding\\nthe compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the\\nEuropean Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have\\nraised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in\\nthe European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less\\npersonalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future\\nplans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple\\nmade certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers\\'\\nability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users\\nthe ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in\\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising\\nrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS\\nchanges beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities\\nwill be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\\nproducts, and standards that we do not control.\\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices.

For example,\\nApple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to\\nour users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own\\nadvertising business. In addition, Google previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to\\nApple's, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization.\\nAdditionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products,\\nsystems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser\\ndevelopers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that\\noperate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our\\nproducts on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access\\nto our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed.

Such actions may adversely affect our users and our\\nrelationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or\\nadvertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by\\nthese actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our\\nbusiness could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that\\nwe do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which\\nmay in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our\\nbusiness.\\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing\\nproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant\\nchanges to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior\\ndevelopment or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed\\nreality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making\\nsignificant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For example, we continue to launch new AI features on our products,\\nincluding support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be\\nsuccessful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of\\nsuch products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue\\nor profits from messaging over the long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and\\nInstagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney General is seeking to enjoin\\nour offering of default end-to-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.\\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail\\nto attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our\\nproducts, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products.

It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI.

We may not always be able to\\nanticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these\\nframeworks as they are still rapidly evolving. We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain\\njurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and technologies. Other companies may\\ndevelop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of\\ndevelopment in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with\\nour ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to\\ncontinue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and physical\\ninfrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, as to which we cannot control the\\navailability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that\\ncan use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize\\nsuch AI technologies. As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the\\ndissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination,\\ncybersecurity attacks including spear phishing attacks, data privacy violations, other activities that threaten people\\'s safety or well-being on- or offline, or to\\ndevelop competing technologies. While we may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and\\nthe inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be\\neffective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments\\nregarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal\\nliability.\\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent\\nwith our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have\\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which\\nhas to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business.

We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued\\ninvestment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants.\\nHowever, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.\\nWe regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our\\nproduct ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed\\nreality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development\\nefforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse\\ntechnologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-\\nparty mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own\\ncompeting products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to\\ncontinue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support\\nthese efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business.

Any of these events could adversely affect our business,\\nreputation, or financial results.\\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), are calculated using internal company data based on\\nthe activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of\\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The\\nmethodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are\\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We\\nregularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve\\ntheir accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or\\nother factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics\\nfor any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as\\ndata limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base\\nthat have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further\\nbelow, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such\\nmargin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP.

As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or\\ntrends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example,\\nto match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user\\nnames. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the\\nfuture contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products,\\nwe have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with\\naccounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product\\ndecisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy\\nof our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies\\nevolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or\\nmachine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of\\n2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited\\nsample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated\\nwith Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\\nperiod. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in\\nusage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.\\nAccordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by\\nuser location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is\\nestimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\\'s\\nactual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the\\nuser\\'s actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our\\nads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our\\nsystems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology,\\nincluding as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to\\nlitigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates.

For\\nexample, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or\\nmanufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\\nmanufacturers or suppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers'\\nexpectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a\\nnumber of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products depends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a\\nsingle region such as Asia. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages, strikes or other disruptions in logistics and the\\nsupply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if\\nwe are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of\\nsuch arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by\\nmacroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments or non-state actors (including international conflicts,\\ntariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or\\nlogistics disruptions.\\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding\\nsourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their\\npractices and standards and have experienced violations of these requirements from time to time. If any supplier or business partner violates laws, fails to\\nimplement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could\\nexperience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\\n32\"),\n",

The demand for our products can also change significantly\\nbetween the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer\\ndemand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international regions, it may be\\ndifficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain\\ntypes of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may\\nadversely affect our operating results.\\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could\\nharm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutory\\ndamages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future.\\nBecause of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages\\neven if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action\\nand other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and\\nsoftware, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class\\naction suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well\\nas other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the\\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements,\\nresulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of biometric technology, our\\nalleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools, our alleged use of\\ncopyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users and allegations of\\nviolations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any\\nnegative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business\\npractices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a\\nsignificant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be\\nreversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has\\noccurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and\\nmay adversely affect the price of our common stock.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary\\ncompanies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures.

We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the\\ncompanies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements,\\nincluding the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our\\nintercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation\\nand certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are\\nsubject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken,\\nincluding our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could\\nincrease our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\\noperations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in\\nconjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate\\nresolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.\\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are\\nmany transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our\\nbusiness, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for\\nincome taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial\\nstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\n34\"),\n",

For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate\\nfor the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions\\nin the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued\\nor such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have\\nenacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we\\noperate our business.\\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit\\nShifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\\ncountries in which we do business. A number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the OECD’s 15% global minimum tax regime. As additional\\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\\ntax payments could increase in future years. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various\\naspects of the current international tax rules under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing rules to calculate income tax, as well as\\nproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have\\nproposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to\\nour business. There are ongoing OECD negotiations that contemplate an alternative to these proposals, which may proliferate in the absence of multilateral\\nagreement.\\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides\\npreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state\\naid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described\\nabove could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position,\\nresults of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts\\nestimated and recorded in our financial statements.\\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary, significantly depending on our stock price.\\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our effective tax rate,\\nsometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that\\nperiod, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2024, excess tax benefits recognized from\\nshare-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $3.22 billion and our effective income tax rate by five percentage points as compared to\\nthe tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in\\nthat period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular\\nperiod will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price,\\nwhich we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\\n35'),\n",

For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\\nChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in\\nviolation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from\\ntime to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and\\nblock access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong\\nhas passed additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other\\noperations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In\\naddition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were\\nthen prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell or deliver advertising, including in countries where access\\nto our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving\\nadvertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese, United States, or other government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based\\nadvertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, including any tariffs implemented by the United States or China, in\\nresponse to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or\\nother penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to\\nreduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or\\nour other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make\\nchanges to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or\\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base,\\nuser engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and\\nour financial results could be adversely affected.\\n37'),\n",

Many of these laws and regulations are subject to\\nchange and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of\\noperations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data\\nuse, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity,\\ncontent, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data\\ndisclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political\\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions,\\nor other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and\\nregulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\\nvarious ways, including for advertising, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we\\nprovide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global\\nrevenue.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\\nFor example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States,\\ncalled the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought\\nby the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final\\nDecision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland’s reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to\\nsuspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including\\nstorage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court.\\nOn March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy\\nFramework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence\\nActivities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States\\nAttorney General as a “qualifying state” under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation\\nto the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the\\nEuropean Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the “Data Privacy Framework List,” maintained and made publicly available by the\\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and\\nwelcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF\\nreplaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU.

If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries\\nand regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services,\\nthe manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\\nunder the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the\\nnotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the\\nCJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR\\'s consistency\\nmechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy\\nregulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data\\nprocessing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of\\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our\\noperations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related\\nrequirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California\\nPrivacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of\\ncertain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have\\nproposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving\\nand subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely\\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy\\nrights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to\\ninterpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting\\nour advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy Directive\\'s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may\\nlead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and\\nnational implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance.\\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our\\nadvertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising\\non Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023\\nwe began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding\\ncompliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal\\nproceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July\\n2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer\\nprotection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024,\\nwe began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported\\nby ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any similar\\ndevelopments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business.

The DMA also includes\\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has\\ncaused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under\\nthe DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of\\njurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the DSA, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and\\nrequirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation\\nand enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In\\naddition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new\\ncompetition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products,\\nincrease the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines\\nor other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising\\nservices or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas,\\nCalifornia, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the\\nservices that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to\\nthem, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect\\nthat may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these\\nstatutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users\\nunder 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year\\nolds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also\\nsubject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant\\ncompliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or\\nother third parties in such transactions. In addition, the Province of British Columbia has considered, and may in the future consider, a bill that would permit\\nthe government to recover public health-related costs potentially associated with providing goods and services in British Columbia, including potentially social\\nmedia services.\\nWe are also subject to disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements regarding our social and environmental risks and initiatives. There has been\\nincreased focus on these initiatives by many regulators, investors, and other stakeholders and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable\\nfederal, state, local or international laws and regulations could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially and adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government actions, have led to, and may in the future\\nlead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, changes to our products, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of\\nnew products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our\\nbusiness, including fines, damages, or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\\nWe have been and remain subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be\\nsubject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices\\nin a manner materially adverse to our business.\\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of\\nwhich are evolving and subject to interpretation.

In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among\\nother things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and\\nlitigation, and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified\\nconsent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient\\ncompliance and violations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and\\nseeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC\\'s action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we\\nwould be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify\\nthe IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue\\nsimilar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are\\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. In addition, we are subject to\\ninquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with various provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and\\nInstagram, including matters related to elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential\\ndeceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and\\nrequirements to change our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, in July 2024, we entered into a settlement to resolve a\\nlawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology.\\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and\\nother jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits\\nconcern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services, digital advertising, and/or\\nmobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by\\nthe FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including\\nby acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust\\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission\\nissued a fine as a result of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition\\nrules.

These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing\\ninvestments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually reallocate resources internally to assist\\nwith these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial\\nmodifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result,\\nwe believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected.\\nFurther, our privacy compliance and oversight efforts have required, and we expect will continue to require, significant time and attention from our\\nmanagement and board of directors.

In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements\\nare constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation.

We are challenging the FTC's\\nadministrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order in its current form, it would limit our ability to\\nprovide certain features and services, engage in certain business practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance\\nand oversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any future modifications to the order),\\nGDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant\\nauthority believes that we are in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations\\nor lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines or damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage), judgments, penalties, or\\nother remedies, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices.

For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright\\nDirective) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which the EU member states have\\nsince implemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online\\nvideo-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. Additionally, Brazil has an intermediary liability framework limiting liability for third-party\\ncontent, which has been challenged as unconstitutional and is under review by the Brazilian Supreme Court. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme\\nCourt heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency\\nAct (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. There also have been, and continue to be, various other\\nlitigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to\\nimpose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, including electoral-related and AI-generated content,\\ncounterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or\\nchange. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial or government-imposed remedies as a\\nresult of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or\\nother penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in\\nEurope, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially significant\\npenalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we\\nhave been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to\\nfines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products\\nor business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the\\nEuropean Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the\\navailability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European\\nCopyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services are subject to restrictions and requirements,\\nand we are subject to increased compliance costs, and potential fines or other penalties in the event of non-compliance, as a result of the Digital Services Act in\\nthe European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, and other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and\\nMedia Regulation Act in Ireland and the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may\\nrequire us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products. For example, as a result of such legislation in Canada, we have ended the\\navailability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the\\nFirst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation or investigations may increase our costs or require significant\\nchanges to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement.\\nAny of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nPayment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other risks that could be costly and difficult to\\ncomply with or that could harm our business.\\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants and\\ndevelopers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among\\nother activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money\\nlaundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual\\ncurrency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new\\nconsumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments activity as well as sharing, collection, and use\\nof payments-related data. For example, the CFPB issued its anticipated Larger Participant Rule, effective January 2025, allowing the CFPB to conduct\\nsupervisory activities over general-use digital consumer payment applications. The Rule, which is under legal challenge by a trade association, could subject\\ncertain of our payments products to this authority.

Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or\\nmitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from\\nusers, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our\\nbusiness and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks),\\nscraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also\\nregularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming,\\nspreading misinformation, or other illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and\\nvolume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging\\ntechnologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-\\nsponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address\\nundesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide,\\ndegrade the user experience or otherwise adversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal\\nsystems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to prevent or disable undesirable activities\\non our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or\\nvendor error or malfeasance; social engineering or other cyber-attacks directed towards our personnel or their access; misuse of company data or systems by\\nour personnel; defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government exploitation or surveillance; breaches of\\nphysical security of our facilities, technical infrastructure, or other equipment; or other threats that evolve. In addition, other parties may attempt to fraudulently\\nor maliciously induce employees, contractors, vendors, or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks\\ncontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and\\nprocesses that are designed to protect our data and user data, to reduce the risk of data loss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our\\nplatform, and to reduce the risk of or detect security breaches, such measures will not provide absolute security, and we cannot assure you that we will be able\\nto react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other security incidents, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. Our business and operations span\\nnumerous geographies around the world and involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties.

In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and\\nbylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our\\ncommon stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding\\nClass B common stock voting as a separate class;\\n• we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters\\nrequiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common\\nstock;\\n48'),\n",

Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\\nAt Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and\\nattacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence\\nand scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services\\nreach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span\\nnumerous geographies around the world, involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on\\nsoftware and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we\\ndiscover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices,\\nfor managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity\\nthreats, we evaluate a variety of developments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and\\nobserved cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes\\nin addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts and\\nconsultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry practices.\\nHowever, we may not be successful in fully addressing such areas for remediation or enhancement. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management\\nprogram to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-\\nparty privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance on the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy\\nprograms and the supporting control frameworks. These processes\\n49'),\n",

Prior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served\\nin senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles across technology organizations.\\nOur cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through a variety of technical and\\noperational measures, and regularly report to our CISO. Our CISO is part of the senior management team at the company and regularly updates the Audit &\\nRisk Oversight Committee on the company’s cybersecurity program, including cybersecurity risks, incidents, and mitigation strategies.\\nIn 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy,\\nresults of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that\\nwe have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents.

Legal Proceedings\\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to numerous claims, litigation,\\nregulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal proceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these\\nmatters are without merit and are vigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or\\nwe may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide to settle litigation, disputes, or other legal\\nproceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us. In addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or\\nregulatory authorities. Any such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\\nbusiness (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have\\nexperienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in\\nlight of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.\\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there\\ncan be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid\\nor limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss,\\nincluding through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services\\nAct, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining\\nguidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various\\naspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control\\nof data without other damage) and/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements. We are also responding to\\nlitigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health\\nand safety impacts on users, particularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful\\ndiscrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax, competition and antitrust, stockholder,\\ncommercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential\\nexposure to substantial damages awards and fines has increased.\\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where\\nthe nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the\\nnature and extent of injunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures, disgorgement, fines or penalties.\\nWhile we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our\\nactivities will not result from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\\nPrivacy and Related Matters\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and\\ncertain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain\\ndata by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With\\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors\\nappealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025.

We entered into a settlement and modified consent order\\nto resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and\\nprocesses for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions\\nremain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\\nmanagement from our business, or adversely affect our business. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted\\nour motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully\\nbriefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021,\\na stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and\\nrelated claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an\\namended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current\\nand former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second\\namended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation. On\\nJanuary 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except\\nMark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding (In the Matter of Facebook, Inc.) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent\\norder, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The\\nunderlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to\\nrule.\\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC),\\nasserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On\\nDecember 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the\\ndistrict court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss\\nour complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy (Jarkesy). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending\\nappeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy. Following the\\nSupreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The\\ndistrict court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to\\ndismiss.\\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was\\nlegally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners\\non those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta’s jurisdictional challenges currently\\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc., and that the nature and scope of any further\\nadministrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional\\nrequirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate\\ncourt to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending.

On December 30, 2024,\\nwe filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a\\nmanner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102\\non the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a fine of\\napproximately EUR €798 million. We appealed the European Commission\\'s decision on January 28, 2025.\\nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model with\\nrequirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary\\nview that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our\\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely\\naffect our business.\\nSecurities and Other Actions\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\\nour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court\\nin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our\\nplatform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\\' claims. On January 17,\\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court\\'s order dismissing the plaintiffs\\' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4,\\n2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit\\'s order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10,\\n2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company\\ndocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and\\nother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being.

Empl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.). On September 30, 2024, the court dismissed certain claims with\\nleave to amend, but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed against us and certain of our current\\nand former directors and officers.\\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our\\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking\\nunspecified damages (Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v.

Putative class actions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school\\ndistricts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United States, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations. On\\nOctober 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re Social Media Adolescent\\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation). Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories began filing lawsuits on these topics in various\\nfederal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child\\nsexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and\\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years\\nold. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country.\\nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to \"social media addiction\" and\\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram.\\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions globally concerning the use of our\\nproducts and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European\\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the\\ndesign and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\\nOther Actions\\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\\nof California (DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc.) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs\\' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the\\nplaintiffs\\' motion for class certification. On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order\\ngranting class certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a\\npetition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2, 2024, which was denied.\\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Kadrey,\\net al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc.) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\\nNew York (Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al., which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California)\\nalleging that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief.\\nThese cases have all been consolidated into Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.\\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Vivek H. Murthy, Surgeon General, et al. v. Missouri, et al., on the question of\\nwhether federal government officials violated the First Amendment in their communications with the company and others related to content moderation\\npractices, and heard argument in Netchoice, et al. v. Paxton and Moody, et al. v. Netchoice et al., regarding the application of the First Amendment relating to\\ncontent moderation on tech platforms. As to Murthy, a majority of the Supreme Court decided the case on plaintiffs\\' standing, declining to rule on the First\\nAmendment questions, and sending the case back down to the lower courts where the case continues. As to NetChoice, the Supreme Court unanimously\\nvacated the intermediate appellate court decisions, remanding the cases back to the lower courts. Although we are not a party in these actions, the ultimate\\nresolution of the lawsuits and similar others still pending in the federal courts could impact our business.\\n55'),\n",

In addition to our historical\\nconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual\\nresults could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those\\ndiscussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\\nmeasurement of our Family metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\\nUnited States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant\\ncurrency basis is presented in the section entitled \"—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we\\ntranslated revenue for the full year 2024 using 2023 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full\\ndescription of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \"—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and\\npresented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness\\nfor comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors\\nshould be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP\\nfinancial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial\\nresults between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics\\nused by management in operating our business.\\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results\\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\\nOur financial results and key Family metrics for 2024 are set forth below. Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50 billion, an increase of 22% compared to\\n2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% compared to 2023.

As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products\\nand user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue and user engagement.\\nFor example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a\\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by\\nads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators\\non our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or\\nannounced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For\\nexample, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and\\nother iOS developers\\' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of\\nthe budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are\\ndeveloping privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we\\nprocess, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data\\ninto our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools\\nto help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad\\nproducts. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery,\\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new\\nfeatures and scaling existing features.\\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for\\nadvertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.\\nHowever, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will\\ncontinue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\\nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity\\nobligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we\\nexpect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.\\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our\\nuser growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as\\ninflation, high interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\\nmacroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial\\nresults in future periods.\\nIn addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users\\' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI\\ninitiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved\\nuser engagement and monetization of our products. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics,\\nin particular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will\\ncontinue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more\\nregions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends adversely affected\\nadvertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\\n61'),\n",

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to\\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing\\nbasis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and\\njudgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial\\nstatements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the\\ngreatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information\\non all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\\namount can be reasonably estimated.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our\\ndefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is\\nrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and\\nunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated\\ninformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations\\nregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted\\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the Irish Data\\nProtection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of\\nan inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\\nrevised in the future.\\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably\\npossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts that materially differ\\nfrom management\\'s estimates of losses, it could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable.

These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties\\nwith our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities\\nsupporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer pricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length\\nprices. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance\\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for\\nincome taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the\\nclosing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such\\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\nValuation of Assets\\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of\\nfuture cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected\\nto generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the\\ncarrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is\\nperformed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not\\nlimited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment;\\noperational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair\\nvalue of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated\\nstatements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a\\nnon-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of\\ndifferences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b)\\nadjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most\\nadvantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur\\nin a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated\\nuseful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this\\nchange in accounting estimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion.

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad.\\nIn 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in\\nall regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the\\naverage price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by\\nan increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement\\ntools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize\\nat lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical\\nwas the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a\\ncombination of price and ad impressions delivered.\\nOther revenue\\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023.

We believe that this seasonality in\\nboth advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third\\nand fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the\\nthird and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17%\\ncompared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\\n72'),\n",

This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2024, as\\nrequired by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also\\ndecreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax\\nrate in 2025 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.\\nA number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax\\nregime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to\\nevaluate the impacts of proposed and enacted legislation with respect to the global minimum tax regime in the jurisdictions we operate in. As additional\\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\\ntax payments could increase in future years.\\n75'),\n",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.\\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our\\nrevenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\n— Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring\\nmonetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this\\ntime, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency\\nexchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of\\n$690 million, $366 million, and $81 million were recognized in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and\\nthe fair value of our long-term debt.\\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S.\\ngovernment agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and\\nsupporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, and\\nthe market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $680 million and\\n$355 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any realized\\ngains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to\\nmaturity.\\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes) outstanding of $29.0 billion and\\n$18.50 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact\\non our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of\\ndeclining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\\nEquity Price Risk\\nOur equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the\\nfair value or carrying value of our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and our non-marketable equity securities are\\ninvestments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values.\\n79'),\n",

Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 29, 2025\\n85\"),\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\\nWe report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns with\\nhow the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of\\nour revenue from advertising.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial\\nstatements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for\\nwhich we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nBalance Sheets Reclassifications\\nCertain prior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\\n• Intangible assets, net was reclassified into other assets\\n• Partners payable was reclassified into accrued expenses and other current liabilities\\n• Long-term income taxes was reclassified out of other liabilities\\nThese reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenue, income from operations, net income or cash flows.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets\\nand liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other\\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not\\nlimited to, those related to loss contingencies, income taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, and\\nfair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and\\nexpectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, and determined we should extend the estimated\\nuseful lives to 5.5 years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2025.\\n92\"),\n",

Revenue is recognized when\\ncontrol of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for\\nthose goods or services.\\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are\\nrecorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for\\ncontracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\\nRevenue includes sales and usage‑based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass‑through agent.\\nAdvertising Revenue\\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for\\nad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are\\nconsidered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the\\naction the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred\\nto our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.\\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the\\nagent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the\\ncustomer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-\\nbased incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these\\namounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates\\nof variable consideration for the reported periods.\\nReality Labs Revenue\\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and\\ncontent. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that\\nreflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.\\nOther Revenue\\nFoA other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our\\nPayments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\\nCost of Revenue\\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the\\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee\\ncompensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of\\nrevenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing\\ncustomer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content\\ncosts.\\n93'),\n",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax\\nrates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the\\ndeferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider\\nall available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable\\nincome and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\\ncomponent of the provision for income taxes.\\nAdvertising Expense\\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred\\nadvertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\\n94\"),\n",

We periodically\\nreview our non-marketable equity securities for impairment.

We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\\nrequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk\\nmeasurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels\\nand bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n95\"),\n",

Additionally, we are required to comply with various\\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\\namount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\\nIf we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in\\nthe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their\\nestimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and\\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to\\nidentifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any\\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition\\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\\nperiod, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as\\nwhen changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is\\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair\\nvalue of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment\\ntesting. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\\namount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are\\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the\\nfuture undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a\\nfinite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment\\ncharges of finite-lived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.\\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are\\nnot amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and\\naccounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives\\nof finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the\\nrevised estimated useful life.

With\\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors\\nappealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In\\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal\\nTrade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a\\nsettlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required\\nus to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiries and\\nlitigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of\\nColumbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The\\nappeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On\\nJuly 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of\\nfiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other\\nstockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against\\ncertain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead\\nplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc.\\nDerivative Litigation. On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed\\nas to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding (In the Matter of Facebook, Inc.) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent\\norder, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The\\nunderlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to\\nrule.\\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC),\\nasserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On\\nDecember 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the\\ndistrict court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss\\nour complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy (Jarkesy). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending\\nappeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy. Following the\\nSupreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024.

Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners\\non those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta’s jurisdictional challenges currently\\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc., and that the nature and scope of any further\\nadministrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional\\nrequirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate\\ncourt to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be\\nsuccessful.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation\\n(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and\\nMember State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding\\nvarious aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model\\nwith requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland\\'s reliance on\\nStandard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The\\nIDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item\\n3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European\\nUnion, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR\\'s cooperation and\\nconsistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending\\nour regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe\\nthere is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material individually or in the aggregate.\\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals\\' information from\\nthird-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive\\nrelief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v.

For example, in 2019 we became the\\nsubject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint (FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc.)\\nagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in\\n2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust\\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss\\nthe complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend.

These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc.

These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country.\\nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to “social media addiction” and\\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram.\\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions globally concerning the use of our\\nproducts and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European\\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the\\ndesign and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\\nOther Actions\\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\\nof California (DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc.) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs\\' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the\\nplaintiffs\\' motion for class certification. On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order\\ngranting class certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a\\npetition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2, 2024, which was denied.\\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Kadrey,\\net al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc.) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\\nNew York (Huckabee, et al. v.

The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to\\npotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax\\nyears. Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years\\nremain open to examination by the IRS. We are under examination by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for our 2020 tax year and our 2021 and subsequent tax\\nyears remain open to examination.\\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\\nwith the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years\\nsubsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a\\npetition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an\\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was\\ncompleted in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2025 which will likely provide a transfer pricing value for intellectual property\\ntransferred. This value will need to be extrapolated into income adjustments to determine the specific tax liability, which will likely remain in dispute and will\\nnot be resolved until the Tax Court enters a decision. If the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties\\nasserted. Once the Tax Court decision is entered, the IRS and Meta will each have the option to file an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its\\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and\\ncertain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to\\napproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the\\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than\\nthe potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails\\nin its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax\\nthat we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2024, we have not\\nresolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax\\nitems that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is\\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining\\nthat are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax\\nauthorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\\n120\"),\n",

Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using\\nasset or liability information.\\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development related\\noperating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are\\nallocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating segments.\\nIndirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security\\nexpenses are mostly allocated based on headcount. Costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure are generally allocated to our\\nsegments based on estimated usage, most of which is allocated to the FoA segment.\\nBeginning in 2024 annual reporting, we adopted ASU 2023-07 retrospectively.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our\\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as\\nof the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\\n2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we\\nare required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods\\nspecified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\\nincluding our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under\\nthe Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the\\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public\\naccounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of\\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of\\nthe Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\\nreporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any\\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\\nand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\nItem 9B. Other Information\\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the officers and directors listed below adopted, modified, or terminated trading plans intended to satisfythe affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\\nOn November 27, 2024, Peggy Alford, a member of our board of directors, entered into a trading plan that provides for the sale of an aggregate of up to\\n$1.2 million worth of shares of our Class A common stock.

Background and Purpose\\nA. Why have we adopted this policy?\\nThis policy has been adopted to help you comply with the federal securities laws and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Under the securities laws, it\\nis generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta” or the “Company”) or any other company while in the possession of\\nmaterial non-public information about that company. It is also generally illegal for any such person to give material non-public information about Meta or any\\nother company to others who then trade on the basis of that information. The consequences of prohibited insider trading or the “tipping” of material non-public\\ninformation can be severe for both individuals engaging in such behavior and for Meta. Violators, as well as Meta, its directors and officers and/or the\\nmanagers of the person violating the rules may be required to pay major civil or criminal penalties (including jail time) and could be subject to private lawsuits\\nin connection with the violation of the insider trading laws.\\nB. What is insider trading?\\n“Insider trading” occurs when any person PURCHASES or SELLS Meta securities on the basis of material non-public information concerning Meta, or from\\ntipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-public information to others. Meta securities include not only stocks, but also include options, restricted\\nstock units (“RSUs”), warrants, bonds and notes as well as derivative securities that are not issued by Meta, such as exchange-traded put or call options or\\nswaps relating to Meta’s securities. “Purchase” includes not only the actual purchase of a security, but any contract to purchase or otherwise acquire a security.\\n“Sale” includes not only the actual sale of a security, but any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of a security.\\nDoes this policy also apply to securities of other companies?\\nInsider trading on the basis of material non-public information about Meta is prohibited under this policy. In connection with your work at Meta, you may also\\nlearn material non-public information about other companies. This policy also prohibits trading in those companies' securities on the basis of material non-\\npublic information about those companies learned through your employment at Meta, and prohibits tipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-\\npublic information about those companies to others.\\nNote that if you learn material non-public information that affects multiple other companies, you may not trade the securities of any of those companies. For\\nexample, say you learn that Meta has plans to acquire Company A. The acquisition is not material to Meta but it is material non-public information about\\nCompany A. There is also a Company B in the same industry that is economically linked to Company A, such that the announcement of the acquisition of\\nCompany A could be expected to affect the stock price of Company B. This policy prohibits trading in securities of both Company A and Company B while in\\npossession of that material non-public information.\\nC. What is “Material Non-public Information”?\\nInformation concerning Meta is considered “MATERIAL” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information\\nimportant in making a decision to purchase or sell Meta’s securities. Material information can be positive or negative and can relate to virtually any aspect of\\nMeta’s business. \\nExamples of material information may include (but are not limited to) facts concerning:\\n• historical or forecasted revenues, earnings or other financial results;\\n• significant new products or services or other product developments;\\n• significant new contracts, customers or partners or the loss of a significant contract, customer or partner;\"),\n",

Determination of\\nwhat may constitute material information will depend upon the facts and circumstances in each particular situation.\\nInformation is “NON-PUBLIC” if it is not available to the general public. In order for information to be considered public, it must be generally available to\\ninvestors and widely disseminated through (i) press releases or corporate blog posts issued by Meta, publicly accessible webcasts or conference calls conducted\\nby Meta or a public filing made by Meta with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), or (ii) publication in a widely-available newspaper, news\\nmagazine or news website. In addition, a sufficient amount of time must pass so that the information has had an opportunity to be digested by the marketplace.\\nAs a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until one (1) full trading day after the release of such information.\\nOne helpful way to determine if you have material non-public information is to ask yourself, “Would the person on the other side of this transaction\\nstill want to complete the trade at this price if he or she knew what I know about Meta?” If the answer is “no,” chances are you possess material non-\\npublic information.\\nA good general rule of thumb: WHEN IN DOUBT, DO NOT TRADE.\\nD. Who is covered under this policy?\\nIf you fall under any of the categories below, you are subject to this policy:\\n• directors, officers and employees of Meta and its subsidiaries;\\n• spouses, domestic partners, dependent children (whether or not minors) and any other family members who live in the same household of any persons\\nlisted in the bullet above;\\n• consultants and contractors of Meta and its subsidiaries; and\\n• any persons or entities or accounts controlled by any of the above or which investment decisions are directed or influenced by any of the above.\\nAny trades in Meta securities made on your behalf, including trades by brokers or other third parties, are subject to this policy, and it is your responsibility to\\nensure all such trading activity is in compliance with this policy. You should also be aware that trades in Meta securities by other members of your immediate\\nfamily (e.g. parents or siblings) as well as unrelated members of your household may be heavily scrutinized based on their proximity to'),\n",

In an insider trading investigation, the burden of proof is often on the insider to prove that trades made by such persons were not the result of information\\nthat the insider may have possessed. Accordingly, while we don’t expect you to monitor what is outside of your control, if you are concerned about this\\npossibility, we suggest that you send a message to these people informing them of Meta’s regular closed trading period and ask them to comply with the closed\\ntrading period.\\nE. Who administers this policy?\\nThe Company’s Chief Legal Officer administers this policy and serves as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer (the “Insider Trading Policy\\nCompliance Officer”). In his or her absence, Meta’s Chief Financial Officer will serve as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer. The Insider Trading\\nPolicy Compliance Officer may also designate one or more individuals in the legal department who may perform the functions of the Insider Trading Policy\\nCompliance Officer. The Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will review and either approve or prohibit all proposed trades requiring preapproval under\\nthis policy according to the procedures set forth in this policy, except that with respect to the Chief Legal Officer, any proposed trades must be approved by\\nMeta’s Chief Financial Officer. All determinations and interpretations by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will be final and not subject to further\\nreview.\\nII. Insider Trading Policies\\nOVERRIDING RULE: NO ONE CAN TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION,\\nAND NO ONE CAN HELP OR ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-\\nPUBLIC INFORMATION.\\nA. No Trading on Material Non-public Information\\nIf you possess material non-public information, you may not purchase or sell, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, any of Meta’s securities, during\\nany period beginning with the date you received the material non-public information concerning Meta, and ending at market open on the second full trading\\nday after public disclosure of that information, or at such time when the non-public information is no longer material.\\nB. No Trading During Closed Trading Periods; Pre-Clearance of Certain Transactions\\n1. Regular Closed Trading Period\\nYou may not trade in any security of Meta during the period beginning at market close on the last day of the middle month of any fiscal quarter of Meta and\\nending at market open on the second full trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter (a “Regular Closed Trading Period”). For\\nexample, if Meta announces its prior fiscal quarter earnings on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 28th, then the Regular Closed Trading Period will end at\\nmarket open on Friday, July 30th, and you would potentially be able to trade in the “open trading window” from Friday, July 30th through market close on\\nAugust 31st. However, these open trading windows should not be considered a safe harbor, as you are always restricted from trading under this policy if you\\npossess material non-public information, even during open trading windows. \\n2. Special Closed Trading Period\\nThe Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer may suspend trading in Meta securities from time to time for some or all persons subject to this policy because\\nof material developments known to Meta or certain persons within Meta and not yet disclosed to the public, as he or she deems appropriate (a “Special Closed\\nTrading Period” and together with a Regular Closed Trading Period, a “Closed Trading Period”), and need not provide any reason for such suspension. The\\nInsider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee will notify you if you are subject to a Special Closed Trading Period, and may not explain the\\nreasons. \\n3. Pre-Clearance of Trades of Restricted Persons\\nIn addition to being subject to the Closed Trading Periods described above, and subject to the 10b5-1 Trading Plan requirements for 10b5-1 Designated Persons\\ndescribed below, all members of the Company’s Board of Directors and “Section 16 officers” (as defined below) and certain other designated employees,\\nconsultants and contractors'),\n",

These Restricted Persons\\nmust contact the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer prior to commencing any trade in Meta’s securities. The Company will notify you if you are on the\\nPre-Clear List.\\nApproval of trades by Restricted Persons on the Pre-Clear List is in the sole discretion of Meta. If a transaction is approved, you must execute the transaction\\nwithin five (5) trading days after the day you receive such approval, but in no event after the commencement of a Closed Trading Period. If for any reason you\\ndo not complete the trade within five (5) trading days after you receive approval, you must obtain pre-clearance again before you can trade the securities. For\\nexample, if the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee approves a trade on a Friday, then you will have until the end of the trading\\nday the following Friday to complete your trade.\\nAny requests to approve a trade while you are subject to a Closed Trading Period will be denied.\\n4. Pre-Clearance of Gifts by 10b5-1 Designated Persons\\nAll 10b5-1 Designated Persons must also pre-clear all gifts of Meta securities and transfers of Meta securities for estate planning purposes with the Insider\\nTrading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee prior to such transfer, even during an open trading window.\\nC. No Tipping\\nYou may not tip (i.e. directly or indirectly pass on) material non-public information to any other person where the information may be used by such person to\\ntrade in the securities to which such information relates. You may not make recommendations or express opinions as to trading in Meta’s securities. For\\nexample, you may not suggest, encourage or recommend that others buy or sell Meta’s securities (or that they refrain from buying or selling in any setting),\\nincluding through participation in any investment or stock-related Meta group, message board or other similar medium.\\nD. No Margining or Pledging of Company Securities\\nYou may not hold Meta securities in margin accounts or pledge such securities as collateral for a loan except in limited circumstances as approved by the\\nCompensation, Nominating, & Governance Committee.

No Trading in Futures or Derivative Securities or Hedging\\nYou may not purchase or sell futures or derivative securities relating to Meta securities, or engage in hedging activities relating to Meta securities, including\\nexchange traded options to purchase or sell such securities, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds, or other arrangements or\\ninstruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of Meta securities.\\nInvestments in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) that track a broad-based index (such as the S&P 500) and/or have holdings comprised of less\\nthan 10% in Meta stock are exempt from this policy. However, investments in any other mutual fund or ETF where Meta stock comprises 10% or more of such\\nfund’s holdings are subject to this policy and shares of such mutual fund or ETF are treated as if they were Meta securities.\\nF. No Short Sales\\nYou may not sell Meta securities “short” (meaning any transaction in which you would benefit from a decline in the price of the securities).\\nG. No Trading on Information Regarding Other Companies\\nIf you, in the course of working for Meta, learn of material non-public information about another company, you may not trade in that company’s securities until\\nthe information becomes public or is no longer material.

Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any subsequent influence over\\nthe amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any\\nmodifications, terminations, or other changes of such plans, must be pre-approved by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee and\\nmay only be adopted, modified or terminated when you are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.\\nSubject to the Transition Period and Affiliated Fund Exclusion provisions described in the Company’s 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy, “10b5-1 Designated\\nPersons” (as defined below) are required to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta’s securities, including the sale of Meta securities that\\nthey control through a trust or other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and shall not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a\\n10b5-1 Trading Plan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate\\nplanning purposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable\\nentities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan if (a) the\\nunderlying gift was effected during an open trading window and (b) the decision to sell such gifted securities is made by an independent investment committee\\nwithout any consultation with or influence of the transferor.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\\nA. Why has Meta adopted this policy?\\nThis policy has been adopted to help you comply with the requirements necessary to properly implement and maintain an approved trading plan\\nestablished pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 (a “10b5-1 Trading Plan”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\\nUnder applicable federal and state securities laws, it is generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta while in the possession of\\nmaterial non-public information about the company. Meta has adopted an “Insider Trading Policy” that sets forth the policies and procedures that have\\nbeen implemented to assist your compliance with these laws. This policy on 10b5-1 Trading Plans makes reference to and uses terms that are defined\\nin the Insider Trading Policy, so please review it in its entirety before reviewing this policy on 10b5-1 Trading Plans.\\nB. What is a 10b5-1 Trading Plan?\\nAs provided in the Insider Trading Policy, transactions in Meta’s securities that are executed pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 Trading Plan will not be\\nsubject to the restrictions of the Insider Trading Policy, and SEC Rule 10b5-1 generally provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability\\nunder the federal securities laws for securities trading plans meeting certain conditions, that are entered into in good faith when you are not in\\npossession of material non-public information and with respect to which you act in good faith for the duration of the plan.\\nC. How does a 10b5-1 Trading Plan Work?\\nThe 10b5-1 Trading Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on those matters to an\\nindependent third party. Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the\\nprice at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any modification or other change of\\nsuch plans, must be pre-approved by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer (as set forth in Section II(H) below) and may only be adopted or modified when\\nyou are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.\\nD. Am I required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan? Am I subject to this policy if I am not required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan, but\\ndecide to do so voluntarily?\\nSubject to the Transition Period and Affiliated Fund Exclusion provisions described below, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” (as defined below) are\\nrequired to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta’s securities, including the sale of Meta securities that they control through a trust\\nor other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and will not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a 10b5-1 Trading\\nPlan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate planning\\npurposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable\\nentities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan\\nif (a) the underlying gift was effected during an open trading window while not in possession of material non-public information and (b) the decision\\nto sell such gifted securities is made by an independent investment committee without any consultation with or influence of the transferor. For\\npurposes of this policy, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” means the following'),\n",

Specialized 10b5-1 Broker: Employees and directors who wish to enter into 10b5-1 plans must use Charles Schwab for execution of such plans. This\\naligns with Meta’s use of Charles Schwab as Meta’s sole broker for the Meta equity program. By limiting employees and directors to the selected broker\\nfor this purpose, Meta hopes to reduce employee fees, facilitate use of 10b5-1 plans by all interested employees, ease administration of plans, and enable\\nthe execution of transactions in a more orderly fashion. Charles Schwab shall provide a form of 10b5-1 plan document for use by employees and directors,\\nas discussed further in Section 2, below.\\n2. Overlapping Plans; Specific Plan Standards for the Broker: Each individual can only have one (1) active trading plan in place at a time. In addition,\\neach individual can only have one (1) “single trade” 10b5-1 trading plan during any 12-month period. If you control, or direct or influence investment\\ndecisions of, any trust or other entity, you may not enter into a separate trading plan for the trust or other entity, but you may include the shares held by\\nsuch trust or other entity in your individual plan.\\nIn addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual may enter into a second trading plan so long as such second plan does not begin trading until after\\nall trades under the first plan are completed or expired without execution.\\nPlans with Charles Schwab typically utilize specified determinants regarding date(s), prices(s), start and end dates and share amounts to be sold under the\\n10b5-1 plan using a template provided by Charles Schwab. Plans with Charles Schwab cannot include determinants that are derived through employee or\\ndirector-provided formulas or algorithms, but can include volume weighted average price (VWAP).\\n3. Number of Shares: There is no limitation on the number of shares that a 10b5-1 plan can cover; however, each individual share of stock can only be\\ncovered by one (1) 10b5-1 plan. In addition, there must be a sufficient number of shares in the 10b5-1-related brokerage account to cover any balance of\\nshares available for sale under the applicable 10b5-1 plan.\\n4. Duration: A 10b5-1 plan cannot have a duration longer than two years.\\n5. Absolute Discretion of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer: The 10b5-1 Compliance Officer shall have absolute discretion to suspend an employee or\\ndirector’s eligibility under this policy or otherwise take appropriate measures in the event that an employee or director appears to be cancelling or\\nmodifying their plan(s) in a serial fashion and/or in a manner that is not in keeping with the spirit of Rule 10b5-1.\\n6. Further Guidance for Section 16 Officers: Employees designated by Meta as subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 16 of the Securities and\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and directors should be mindful of SEC filing requirements and stockholder concerns when designing their 10b5-1\\nplans.'),\n",

Under the securities laws, it\\nis generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta” or the “Company”) or any other company while in the possession of\\nmaterial non-public information about that company. It is also generally illegal for any such person to give material non-public information about Meta or any\\nother company to others who then trade on the basis of that information. The consequences of prohibited insider trading or the “tipping” of material non-public\\ninformation can be severe for both individuals engaging in such behavior and for Meta.

What is insider trading?\\n“Insider trading” occurs when any person PURCHASES or SELLS Meta securities on the basis of material non-public information concerning Meta, or from\\ntipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-public information to others.

In connection with your work at Meta, you may also\\nlearn material non-public information about other companies.

For\\nexample, say you learn that Meta has plans to acquire Company A. The acquisition is not material to Meta but it is material non-public information about\\nCompany A. There is also a Company B in the same industry that is economically linked to Company A, such that the announcement of the acquisition of\\nCompany A could be expected to affect the stock price of Company B.

Determination of\\nwhat may constitute material information will depend upon the facts and circumstances in each particular situation.\\nInformation is “NON-PUBLIC” if it is not available to the general public.
